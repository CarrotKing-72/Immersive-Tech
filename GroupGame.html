            <h3>Unity Group Game Project â€” "OverGrown"</h3>
            <p>For my 1st-year Unity group project, I served as the main code developer for a 2D game inspired by Overcooked and Stardew Valley, set in a dynamic greenhouse environment. Our team collaborated to develop the concept, with my primary role focusing on feature planning, coding, and technical problem-solving.</p>

            <h4>Initial Concept & Planning</h4>
            <p>We started with a core idea to combine fast-paced task management with strategic farming mechanics. I spearheaded the design of key gameplay features and identified the coding systems needed to bring them to life. The team collaborated on concept art, iterating on the game's name, visual design, and unique mechanics.</p>
            <p>research was split between us as a group equally, my main job was to plan out the features we wanted in the game and then give a baseline of what i would need to code in to implement these features into the game.<br><br> the art style was something we all talked about as a team, initially we wanted to go with a 2.5d or 3d game with 2d assets for this but quickly agreed this would take to much time and force us to cut back on the projects features. We moved onto a 2d game with the camera and art heavily inspired by stardew valley (Barone, E. (2016) Stardew Valley. [Video Game] ConcernedApe. Available on: PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch.).<br><br> our main theme was a green house but inspired by ancient greece mythology, hence the more temple like greenhouse look, this idea devolved slightly as we didnt have time to implement the themed plants we had planned so we kept the art and moved on.<br><br> For the name we wanted it to capture the games style and gameplay as much as possible whilst still being a good name that is fun and easy to remember, garden of the gods was our initial idea but due to the fact we couldnt add in enough greek mythos to link to we had to pivot into overgrown which kept the essence in showing the player its about plant growth and tied into the gameplay theme of our project.  </p>
            <p>The original idea included plants with special attributes, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bomb Plant: Destroys other plants, forcing players to restart.</li>
                <li>Time Plant: Alters growth speeds.</li>
                <li>Points Plant: Multiplies the points earned on harvest.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>concept art was also drawn up by the digital media design students which we then took and used piskel (PiskelApp. (n.d.). Piskel - Free online sprite editor. [online] Available at: https://www.piskelapp.com) to create the pixelised versions that we used in the games design</p>

                <img src="gp2.png" alt="gp2" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;">
            </div>
            <h4>Development & Coding</h4>
            <p>Once basic assets were established, I began implementing core features like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plant growth system</li>
                <li>Customer order system</li>
                <li>Point scoring mechanics</li>
            </ul>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="gp3.png" alt="gp3" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;">
            </div>
            <p>However, I encountered the challenge of feature creep, attempting to implement too many features within a limited timeframe. To overcome this, I refocused on the core mechanics essential to the player experience. Simplifying the design required critical problem-solving, especially when dealing with unexpected bugs. One such challenge involved a missing collider during the pickup and placement system, which took a full day to diagnose and resolve. These moments taught me the importance of methodical debugging and time management.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h4>Gameplay Mechanics</h4>
            <p> Customer order system:<br><br> this was a tricky feature to implement and took a bit of back and forth with how i went about it, i had the customer order script link up with a ui element to display the customers order and a warning if you try to add too many orders 
                <pre><code>    UpdateOrderText();
                // Clear any previous warning text
                if (warningText != null)
                {
                    warningText.SetText("");
                }
            }
            else
            {// Display warning message
                if (warningText != null)
                {
                    warningText.SetText("Complete the current order before generating a new one.");
                    Debug.Log("Warning text updated: " + warningText.text);
                }
                else
                {
                    Debug.LogError("Warning text component is null.");
                }
            }</code></pre></p>
            <p>for the main element of the customer order i defined 3 different game objects which were the plants stages of gorwth and then used that to generate a random order size from 1-3 items and use each of the 3 objects randomly to generate random orders each time of different lenghts.</p>
            <pre><code> private void GenerateOrder()
                {
                    if (currentOrder.Count == 0)
                    {
                        int orderSize = Random.Range(1, 4); // Generate an order size between 1 and 3
               
                        for (int i = 0; i < orderSize; i++)
                        {
                            string selectedStage = plantStages[Random.Range(0, plantStages.Length)];
                            GameObject[] selectedPlants = GetPlantsByStage(selectedStage);
                            GameObject selectedPlant = selectedPlants[Random.Range(0, selectedPlants.Length)];
                            Vector3 originalPosition = selectedPlant.transform.position;
               
                            currentOrder.Add($"{selectedPlant.name} ({selectedStage})");
                            currentOrderObjects.Add(selectedPlant);
                            originalPositions.Add(originalPosition);
                        }</code></pre>
            <p>lastly for the main chunk of code on the order system i had to make sure the game knew when the order was complete, this was done via collision boxes in the game and the script checking which objects have been provided and if they match the order> when the correct objects are provided it removes it from the order till no items are need and the order is complete, score is then added and text appears completing the order.</p>
            <pre><code> private void CompleteOrderItem(int index) // Complete order item at index
                            {
                                if (currentOrderObjects[index] != null) 
                                {
                                    currentOrderObjects[index].SetActive(false);
                                    currentOrderObjects[index].transform.position = originalPositions[index];
                                }
                           
                                currentOrder.RemoveAt(index);
                                currentOrderObjects.RemoveAt(index);

                                if (currentOrder.Count == 0) // Check if the order is complete

                                    {
                                        score += 100;
                                    }
                                    else
                                    {
                                        score += 50;
                                    }

                                    orderCorrect = true; // Reset for the next order
                           
                                    // Return assigned objects to their set positions
                                    for (int i = 0; i < returnObjects.Length; i++)
                                    {
                                        if (returnObjects[i] != null)

                    <br><br><p>Plant Growth system:<br><br>this mechanic was very tricky and took a loing time to test and implement properly. orignially i did not have a clue in any way to go about adding this feature but after some brainstorming i decided to use object activation and postitioning as how i did it, this was achieved by setting a timer for the growth cycle, defining placement points in scene (the plant growth station) and then checking if the plant is on the point.</p>
                            <pre><code>  public void CheckPlacement(GameObject placedObject)

<p>other than a basic player movement system the final major feature that i implemented was the item pickup ability and object creator script which allowed the player to generate a new plant pot as they would give their other ones to customers in their orders. object creation was done by checking if the player was in the interaction range of the station and if so then the regular plant pot object that would have been deactivated in the scene after the growth cycles would be move and reactivated to the pot station providing the illusion of making another pot </p>

    <p>for object pickup i had defined a point on the players body that the item would attatch to, then for pickup logic i used coliders and layers to check the distance from the object and if its in range then the object would be moved to a child of the pickup oint on the player.dropping or placing was done in the same way, if oyu were in range of a placement point then the object would be moved there, if not then it would simply detatch and remain on the floor </p>

            <p>The game's art and assets were created by my teammates, with the exception of the plant pot design, which I produced using one of my teammate's designs as inspiration. Working from a concept created by another team member taught me how to adapt and align with a shared creative vision.</p>

            <h4>Music & Sound</h4>
            <p>Finding suitable, royalty-free background music proved difficult, so I decided to create my own original soundtrack. I recorded my own guitar playing, adding a personal touch to the gameâ€™s atmosphere.</p>
