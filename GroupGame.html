            <h3>Unity Group Game Project — "OverGrown"</h3>
            <p>For my 1st-year Unity group project, I served as the main code developer for a 2D game inspired by Overcooked and Stardew Valley, set in a dynamic greenhouse environment. Our team collaborated to develop the concept, with my primary role focusing on feature planning, coding, and technical problem-solving.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="gp1.png" alt="gp1" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;">
            </div>
            <h4>Initial Concept & Planning</h4>
            <p>We started with a core idea to combine fast-paced task management with strategic farming mechanics. I spearheaded the design of key gameplay features and identified the coding systems needed to bring them to life. The team collaborated on concept art, iterating on the game's name, visual design, and unique mechanics.</p>
            <p>The original idea included plants with special attributes, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bomb Plant: Destroys other plants, forcing players to restart.</li>
                <li>Time Plant: Alters growth speeds.</li>
                <li>Points Plant: Multiplies the points earned on harvest.</li>
            </ul>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="gp2.png" alt="gp2" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;">
            </div>
            <h4>Development & Coding</h4>
            <p>Once basic assets were established, I began implementing core features like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plant growth system</li>
                <li>Customer order system</li>
                <li>Point scoring mechanics</li>
            </ul>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="gp3.png" alt="gp3" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;">
            </div>
            <p>However, I encountered the challenge of feature creep, attempting to implement too many features within a limited timeframe. To overcome this, I refocused on the core mechanics essential to the player experience. Simplifying the design required critical problem-solving, especially when dealing with unexpected bugs. One such challenge involved a missing collider during the pickup and placement system, which took a full day to diagnose and resolve. These moments taught me the importance of methodical debugging and time management.</p>
            
            <h4>Art & Assets</h4>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="gp4.png" alt="gp4" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;">
            </div>
            <p>The game's art and assets were created by my teammates, with the exception of the plant pot design, which I produced using one of my teammate's designs as inspiration. Working from a concept created by another team member taught me how to adapt and align with a shared creative vision.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="gp5.png" alt="gp5" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;">
            </div>
            <h4>Music & Sound</h4>
            <p>Finding suitable, royalty-free background music proved difficult, so I decided to create my own original soundtrack. I recorded my own guitar playing, adding a personal touch to the game’s atmosphere.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="gp6.png" alt="gp6" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;">
                <div style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="gp7.png" alt="gp7" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;">
                </div>
            </div>
            <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
            <p>This project was an invaluable learning experience. I learned how to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Prioritize and streamline core features to meet deadlines.</li>
                <li>Approach debugging with patience and strategy, especially when dealing with collider issues.</li>
                <li>Collaborate within a team, using design ideas from others as inspiration for my own contributions.</li>
                <li>Be resourceful, as demonstrated by my decision to compose custom game music.</li>
            </ul>
