        <p>Project Overview: For this Blender project, I set out to create a small, low-poly world slice inspired by a plains environment. My vision for the scene included a bridge, foliage, and trees, with the initial hope of incorporating animals as well. However, as I progressed, I realized that adding animals was beyond the project's scope due to time and complexity constraints. Despite this, I remained focused on creating a visually appealing and cohesive scene. <br><br>Blender Foundation (2024) Blender (Version 4.2) [Computer software].

        <br>
        <p>my main inspiration throughout this project was a photo in which i really wanted to capture the essence and feel of as much as possible in my project although due to time restrictions i couldnt add everything i wanted to like animals etc.</p>

        <p> time management was a big thing i struggled with throughout this project as i am not used to juggling many different projects at once, once i got the assignment i started work immediatly and spent time getting the base layout and structure of the scene right as you saw above.<br><Br>When more work of other projects piled up work paused on blender for a few weeks until the 25th of november which i then started to resume my progress again, i spent a good amount of time fine tuning the colours as to not seem basic and too bright. <br><br>Then the grass was next where i took around 2 days on and off to move around the grass and place it in a way that it did not crowd the scene but also not leaving it bare. As the deadline approached i added the bridged texture and details plus i managed to sculpt some mushrooms to place around the scene which tied everything together just in time for the due date.

        <p>Initial Challenges:
            One of the most significant challenges I faced was learning to navigate Blender's controls and workflow. As a beginner, mastering the basics of 3D modeling, texturing, and scene composition took considerable time and effort. This steep learning curve slowed down my progress initially and required  persistence to overcome. However, as I became more familiar with the software, my confidence grew, and I was able to work more efficiently.<br><br>To help me learn the basics in a relevant manner to the task i turned to youtube to find some helpful tutorials that i could use to learn the skills i needed specific to this task, i followed one youtube video to help me during the whole creation process of this task (Polyfjord (2022) ‘How to Make Low Poly World in Blender 3.3 Beginner Tutorial’, YouTube video, 15 September. Available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZvkhgK8doE) this video taught me a lot in terms of skills and techniques also providing inspiration on how i would frame my scene and layout my world.</p>

            <br>
        <p>Development Process:
            Once I had a solid understanding of Blender's core functions, I began by constructing the bridge. I used simple plank shapes, arranging them in a way that felt natural and visually appealing. To enhance the bridge’s realism, <br><br>I sourced a texture from one of blenders own built in textures (Blender Foundation (2024) Wood Texture. Blender 3D Software. Available at: https://www.blender.org (Accessed: 08 December 2024)) which i then took and applied to the wooden planks of the bridge. <br><br>Applying the texture to the planks presented another challenge, as I had to experiment with UV mapping and texture scaling to get the desired look. After some trial and error, I achieved a result that significantly improved the bridge’s appearance within the scene.</p>

                <img src="bl5.png" alt="b15" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;">

            </div>
        
            <br>
        <p>Next, I focused on the foliage and mushrooms, which turned out to be the most technically demanding elements. Creating the mushrooms required a blend of techniques learned from multiple tutorials, including shaping, texturing, and detailing. This process was time-consuming, but I believe the mushrooms became a crucial visual element that ties the entire scene together. The foliage and trees were simpler to create, but I paid close attention to their placement to ensure the scene felt balanced and natural.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Reflection and Lessons Learned:
            Overall, I am proud of the final outcome of this project. Despite the initial setbacks with Blender’s learning curve, I successfully created a visually appealing scene that captures the essence of a small plains world slice. If I were to approach this project again with more time, I would aim to further enhance the realism of the water, making it look and behave like an actual fluid. I would also like to introduce animals into the scene to add more life and movement, as originally envisioned. This project taught me the value of persistence, creative problem-solving, and the importance of leveraging online resources to overcome technical challenges.</p>
