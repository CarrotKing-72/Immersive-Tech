        <div class="content">
            <p>for the 2 page cv i started looking around at different examples that incorporated both style and function into their designs to take inspiration from, after looking through a few different designs i settles on a template that i could alter to fit my style well  </p>
            <br>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="cv1.png" alt="cv1" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;">
    
            </div>
            <br>
            <p> using this i compleletly made it my own adding in my branding and all the facts and information needed to fill out a cv effectivly including employment and past education, skills and hobbies etc. i messed up a bit on some header fonts as they dont show up as much on the screen shots, i also included a link to my online portfolio at the botttom of the cv so future employers can be redirected here to see all of my progress. </p>
            <br>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="cv2.png" alt="cv21" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;">
    
            </div>
            <br>
            <p> for the powerpoint i had to find a brand i wanted to work for whilst also thinking of a cohesive theme that fit with my 2 page cv i had created and with the brand and its vision so i went with a company whose games i had been playing for a while and who i follow closely which was insomniac games the makers of the spiderman games on the playstation 4 and 5</p>
            <br>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="pp1.png" alt="pp1" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;">
    
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>i chose a more sleek design that incoportated the companys logo colours whilst fitting with the color scheme of the 2 page cv i had created, i chose to be more minimalist in my design aswell showing some of the companies game charatcers but keeping them to silouettes that dont distract too mych from the main content of the slide </p>
            <br>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="pp2.png" alt="pp2" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;">
    
            </div>
            <br>
            <p> then i moved onto a brief history of the company opting to only include major points in their timeline to emphasize certain points and to not clutter the slide to keep the minimal sleek design, game logos in the same style as the previous pages characters were also added in to further push the products they have made in a way that does not overshadow the information but compliments it</p>
            <br>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="pp3.png" alt="pp3" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;">

    
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>this slide was relatively simple, i just went on their own website and sourced 4 images of their main most recent products and added them in, i played around with the formatting settings to find a way i like that made the images not feel boring and flat against the page</p>
        
            <br>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="pp4.png" alt="pp4" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;">
    
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>finally to end off the powerpoint i opted for the fun facts page to be text only as to balance out from the last pages which only included images, i went on insomniacs oown website aswell as a few other websites and found some interesting facts that i thought would be interesting to learn and fit with the powerpoints vision and requirements.</p>
