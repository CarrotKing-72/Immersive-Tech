            <h2>Pixel Art Project</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>For this project I chose to make a 2d pixel art level of a dungeon setting like in the old 2d games, the original base idea was to have a grungy dungeon with cells and inmates in them, one player character that’s a knight/ adventurer and I also wanted to include a prison guard that would walk around the scene as well to give it some more life, this is a very basic drawing I did when first planning out the scene: </p>

            <br>
            <p>I also looked around the internet for more ideas and inspiration on the level of detail I wanted to go into </p>

           <p>The main inspiration I took from these images was how I wanted the general look of the brick back and foreground to look as well as the main perspective I was going for in the scene I also liked the look of the cells and torches on the wall in the (Lantos,2016) image but preferred the grey tone in the (cainos, 2022) image.</p>
           <br>
           <p>I started to work on the project on the 30th of January and began with the wall torch asset that I wanted to implement, I began with creating the base image of the torch with the depth in the wood and wall mount then the base flame aswell before animating </p>
              <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="pa4.png" alt="er1" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;"> </div>
           <p>Although I wasn’t a fan of how the flame turned out in this version so when I went to create a flicker animation I widened the base of the fire and shortened it to create an effect where the flame was stronger and seemed to have more substance to it.</p>
              <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="pa5.png" alt="er1" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;"> </div>
            <p>then I animated each frame of the fire totalling 6 frames, with slight variations in the flame size and shape along with how the sparks travelled off of the torch as well to produce a fluid and not too over the top animation.</p> 
              <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="pa6.gif" alt="er1" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;"> </div> 
            <p>I took about a weeks break to work on some other projects but when I started to work on the scene again I began with making a nice wall texture that I could use to form the overall scene in the level, I used a mainly grey pallet using lighter and darker shades to create depth and texture in the brick I also used varying brick sizes to not seem so repetitive which allowed me to use the texture as a tile pallet and create the whole background out of the wall asset</p>
                <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="pa7.png" alt="er1" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;"> </div>
            <p>It took me some time to get the way I wanted to shade the brick correctly and once I got the idea I then used it over the whole wall till I got this: </p>
                 <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="pa8.png" alt="er1" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;"> </div>
            <p>It gives a nice effect of depth when looked at from further away like it would be in the scene itself, once that’s done I then took the texture and flipped it both horizontally and vertically to create 4 variations that I used in the tile pallet for better diversity within the scene art wise.
I then created a blank 2d unity project and populated with the wall asset, trying to create variation with the 4 different versions I made</p>
                    <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="pa9.png" alt="er1" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;"> </div>
            <p>However it started to look good the only issue was near the bottom the wall connected odd and started to give a weird look to the scene, I deal with that a bit later on though, next I added in the wall torch I made with a light using unity’s lighting tools </p>
                    <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="pa10.png" alt="er1" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;"> </div>
                    <br>
                    <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="pa11.gif" alt="er1" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;"> </div>
            <p>I added two torches to the scene and using a small script that I wrote it coded a light pulsing animation to the torch lights</p>
            <pre><code>
public class TorchLight : MonoBehaviour
{
    Light2D lightcomponent;
    float maxIntensity = 6.0f;
    float minIntensity = 4.0f;

    // Start is called once before the first execution of Update after the MonoBehaviour is created
    void Start()
    {
        lightcomponent = GetComponent<Light2D>();
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        if (lightcomponent != null)
        {
            lightcomponent.intensity = Mathf.Lerp(minIntensity, maxIntensity, Mathf.PingPong(Time.time, 1));
        }
    }
}
</pre></code>
<p>To deal with the issue of the floor of the game looking weird due to how the textures connected i decided to make a basic floor texture that just left the bottom of the screen dark like it was looking underground, this not only gave me more of a substantial floor to work with but it also gave more depth and perspective to the scene overall</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="pa12.png" alt="er1" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;"> </div>
<p>After that I was pretty happy with how the scene was coming together overall and due to the other projects that were coming up and other work I had to do, I put this project on the backburner for a while.
When I started to work on it again the next thing to do was make the cells that show up in level, this is where I had the most issues in asset creation because I didn’t know how to create the cell door with depth and add things inside the cell which was part of my original plan when I started. </p>
  <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="pa13.png" alt="er1" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;"> </div>
<p>This was as far as I got before I took a break as I had no clue on how to add cell bars and then create anything of detail within the cell and any way I tried it didn’t look good, in the end I made the decision to drop the notion of adding  stuff within the cell because I didn’t have the time or the skill right now to include it so I back pedalled a bit and simplified into just the cell and a dark inside to create the idea that something could be in there but the conditions are so bad you cant see in to look. After some tampering and taking what I had learned previously with adding depth and texture on the wall with colour shades and different darker tones I managed to create a cell I was happy with</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="pa14.png" alt="er1" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;"> </div>
<p>Overall I added in different stages of darkness in the cell to show the light bleeding in outside into eventual pure darkness.
Once added in the cell doors tied the whole scene together. The next and final thing I needed to tackle was adding in a player character so you can go and look around the scene yourself as a player.</p>
     <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="pa15.png" alt="er1" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;"> </div>
<p>This was the hardest thing to create out of the whole project for me, at first I tried to use a sprite I created for something else and alter it to fit the theme of this setting however I only had an idle animation for him sorted out and when I attempted a walking animation I could not no matter how much I altered or tried to make the leg movement look smooth, also when I tested out the sprite in the scene It did not fit at all anyway, so I pivoted into trying to make something a bit more fitting than reuse older assets.</p>
     <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="pa16.png" alt="er1" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;"> </div>
<p>I decided to create a knight character for the scene which I thought would be more fitting for the scene after some playing around I came up with a simple look but making use of colours and shading it looks a lot more detailed than it is. </p>
        <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="pa17.png" alt="er1" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;"> </div>
<p>Also I kept the legs a lot less detailed than the other asset meaning the walking animation could be created easier as the legs could be distorted without it looking bad with more detailed sprites.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="pa18.png" alt="er1" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;"> </div>
    
<p>I did mess up a bit when making the idle animation though as when you are in the scene in game the character actually moves up a pixel and back down which makes it float slightly up and down.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="pa19.gif" alt="er1" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;"> </div>
<p>Finally I had the scene finished and a working player with animations in the game so you can move around and also have an idle animation, the way I did this was I had a simple animator component setup and a walking Boolean which when true would trigger the walking animation and when false the idle animation would play </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="pa20.png" alt="er1" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;"> </div>
<p>This was all controlled by a simple player controller script that covered left and right movement, or since its a 2d game it would be forwards and backwards movement</p>
<pre><code>
public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float moveSpeed = 5f; // Speed of the player
    private Animator animator;  // Reference to the Animator component
    private Rigidbody2D rb;     // Reference to the Rigidbody2D component
    private float moveInput;    // Horizontal input

    void Start()
    {
        // Get references to the Animator and Rigidbody2D components
        animator = GetComponent<Animator>();
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
    }

    void Update()
    {
        // Get horizontal input (-1 for A, 1 for D, 0 for no input)
        moveInput = Input.GetAxisRaw("Horizontal");

        // Set the walking parameter in the Animator based on movement
        animator.SetBool("walking", moveInput != 0);
    }

    void FixedUpdate()
    {
        // Move the player left or right
        rb.linearVelocity = new Vector2(moveInput * moveSpeed, rb.linearVelocity.y);
    }
}
</pre></code>
<p>Overall I am very  happy with how the level turned out even with outside pressures of other projects that I had to do alongside this one, but I do think that there were a lot of issues and things I encountered that I have learned from for example this was the first time I have had to manage more than 1 major project at a time and finding the balance to work on them and giving them the time they need individually to be the best I can make them was a challenge and I do not think that I managed my time to the best of my ability, also scope was still an issue with this project and I was forced to re-evaluate how I approach more projects in the future, I had to drop the idea of adding in a enemy npc that walked around the level and I also had to simplify a few assets like the dungeon cell which I originally wanted inmates to be in and animated.
In the future I will make sure that when I approach similar projects I will know my abilities and give myself the right amount of time that I need to develop my skills and make the best final result possible.
